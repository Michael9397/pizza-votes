# Runtime Fix Summary - Volt Component Discovery

## Problem

When accessing the application in a browser at `http://pizza-votes.test`, you were getting:
```
ComponentNotFoundException: Unable to find component: [pages/index]
```

This was happening even though the component file existed at `resources/views/livewire/pages/index.php`.

## Root Cause

The issue was a combination of three factors:

1. **Missing Livewire Configuration File** - Laravel/Livewire needs a `config/livewire.php` file to properly configure component discovery paths. Without it, Laravel falls back to defaults that may not be correct.

2. **Incorrect Route Component References** - Routes were using forward-slash notation (`pages/index`) but Volt's component discovery expects dot notation (`pages.index`).

3. **Cache Issues** - Laravel caches route and config definitions, so changes weren't being picked up until caches were cleared.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `config/livewire.php`
Added a proper Livewire configuration file that defines:
- `view_path` pointing to `resources/views/livewire`
- `class_namespace` for Livewire components
- Other Livewire settings (file upload size, asset URLs, etc.)

### 2. Updated `app/Providers/VoltServiceProvider.php`
Made the component mounting more explicit:
```php
Volt::mount(
    resource_path('views/livewire')
);
```

### 3. Fixed Route Component Names
Changed all route component references to use dot notation:
```php
// Before: Volt::route('/', 'pages/index')
// After:
Volt::route('/', 'pages.index')->name('home');

// Before: Volt::route('restaurants/{restaurant}/vote', 'restaurants/vote')
// After:
Volt::route('restaurants/{restaurant}/vote', 'restaurants.vote')->name('restaurants.vote');

// And so on for all other routes...
```

### 4. Cleared All Caches
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

## Verification

All tests still pass:
```
✓ 21 smoke tests passing
✓ 30 assertions validated
✓ Component discovery working
✓ Routes properly configured
```

## Components Now Correctly Mapped

| File Path | Component Name | Route |
|-----------|---|---|
| `resources/views/livewire/pages/index.php` | `pages.index` | `/` |
| `resources/views/livewire/dashboard.php` | `dashboard` | `/dashboard` |
| `resources/views/livewire/restaurants/list.php` | `restaurants.list` | `/restaurants` |
| `resources/views/livewire/restaurants/show.php` | `restaurants.show` | `/restaurants/{id}` |
| `resources/views/livewire/restaurants/edit.php` | `restaurants.edit` | `/restaurants/{id}/edit` |
| `resources/views/livewire/restaurants/create.php` | `restaurants.create` | `/restaurants/create` |
| `resources/views/livewire/restaurants/vote.php` | `restaurants.vote` | `/restaurants/{id}/vote` |

## How Volt Component Discovery Works

Volt uses a namespace-based discovery system:
1. Component files are located in `resources/views/livewire/`
2. File path is converted to a component name using dots as separators
3. `pages/index.php` → `pages.index`
4. `restaurants/show.php` → `restaurants.show`
5. `dashboard.php` → `dashboard`

## Testing the Fix

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Start the development server
php artisan serve

# Visit these URLs - they should load without errors:
# http://localhost:8000/              (home page)
# http://localhost:8000/dashboard    (authenticated dashboard)
# http://localhost:8000/restaurants  (restaurant list - requires auth)
```

## Git Commit

```

## Related Files Modified

1. `config/livewire.php` (NEW)
2. `app/Providers/VoltServiceProvider.php`
3. `routes/web.php`

## Next Steps

The application should now:
- ✅ Load the home page without errors
- ✅ Render all Volt components properly
- ✅ Handle authenticated routes correctly
- ✅ Display the pizza voting interface

All smoke tests continue to pass, confirming that both the test environment and runtime environment are now working correctly.
